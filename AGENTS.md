# Mapocock.Skills

## Repo Context

- Describe this repo's purpose, canonical planning surfaces, and operating model here.

## Repo-Specific Guidance

- Add the exact commands, constraints, and local conventions this repo expects.

## Policy Loading Contract

- `AGENTS.md` is a routing surface, not a one-time pointer.
- Re-read the relevant policy files under `docs/dev/policies/` at the start of any non-trivial turn.
- Re-read the relevant policy files when task scope changes mid-session.
- When behavior is ambiguous, prefer re-reading policy over improvising from stale assumptions.

## Policy Re-read Triggers

- re-read planning-related policy before opening, revising, or closing a substantive plan
- re-read documentation-related policy before changing docs, contracts, or canonical authorities
- re-read validation and closeout policy before claiming work complete
